# POX is a networking software platform written in Python

# POX started life as an OpenFlow controller, but can now also function
# as an OpenFlow switch, and can be useful for writing networking software
# in general.

# POX officially requires Python 2.7 (though much of it will work fine
# fine with Python 2.6), and should run under Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.
