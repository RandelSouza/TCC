# POX is a networking software platform written in Python

# POX started life as an OpenFlow controller, but can now also function
# as an OpenFlow switch, and can be useful for writing networking software
# in general.

# POX officially requires Python 2.7 (though much of it will work fine
# fine with Python 2.6), and should run under Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.
# (And just about anywhere else -- we've run it on Android phones,
# under FreeBSD, Haiku, and elsewhere.  All you need is Python!)
# You can place a pypy distribution alongside pox.py (in a directory
# named "pypy"), and POX will run with pypy (this can be a significant
# performance boost!).

# POX currently communicates with OpenFlow 1.0 switches and includes
# special support for the Open vSwitch/Nicira extensions.

# pox.py boots up POX. It takes a list of module names on the command line,
# locates the modules, calls their launch() function (if it exists), and
# then transitions to the "up" state.
