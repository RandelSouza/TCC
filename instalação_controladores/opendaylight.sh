# Our Mission
# Communications providers and enterprises alike are eager to build or adapt their networks to be more flexible and responsive to their organizations’ and customers’ needs. At the same time, they are driving network automation to improve operational efficiency. OpenDaylight, the largest open source SDN controller, is helping lead this transition.
# OpenDaylight (ODL) is a modular open platform for customizing and automating networks of any size and scale. The OpenDaylight Project arose out of the SDN movement, with a clear focus on network programmability. It was designed from the outset as a foundation for commercial solutions that address a variety of use cases in existing network environments.

#Use Cases
#The OpenDaylight platform (ODL) provides a flexible common platform underpinning a wide variety of applications and Use Cases. Read about some of the most common use cases here – and then let your imagination run free.

# OpenDaylight + Open Networking
# The OpenDaylight Foundation promotes and advances the global development,
# distribution and adoption of the ODL platform. The work we do is sustained by our members, who are committed to collaborating within an open governance framework to solve our industry’s shared challenges. Learn more about how the Project is governed, about our advisors and board of directors,
# and how your company can support and advance OpenDaylight and the open networking ecosystem.

# Introduction
# The OpenDaylight project is an open source platform for Software Defined Networking (SDN) that uses open protocols to provide centralized, programmatic control and network device monitoring. Like many other SDN controllers, OpenDaylight supports OpenFlow, as well as offering ready-to-install network solutions as part of its platform.

# Much as your operating system provides an interface for the devices that comprise your computer, OpenDaylight provides an interface that allows you to connect network devices quickly and intelligently for optimal network performance.

# It’s extremely helpful to understand that setting up your networking environment with OpenDaylight is not a single software installation. While your first chronological step is to install OpenDaylight, you install additional functionality packaged as Karaf features to suit your specific needs.

# Before walking you through the initial OpenDaylight installation, this guide presents a fuller picture of OpenDaylight’s framework and functionality so you understand how to set up your networking environment. The guide then takes you through the installation process.

# What’s different about OpenDaylight
# Major distinctions of OpenDaylight’s SDN compared to traditional SDN options are the following:

# A microservices architecture, in which a “microservice” is a particular protocol or service that a user wants to enable within their installation of the OpenDaylight controller, for example:
# A plugin that provides connectivity to devices via the OpenFlow or BGP protocols
# An L2-Switch or a service such as Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).
# Support for a wide and growing range of network protocols beyond OpenFlow, including SNMP, NETCONF, OVSDB, BGP, PCEP, LISP, and more.
# Support for developing new functionality comprised of additional networking protocols and services.
# Note

# A thorough understanding of the microservices architecture is important for experienced network developers who want to create new solutions in OpenDaylight. If you are new to networking and OpenDaylight, you most likely won’t design solutions, but you should comprehend the microservices concept to understand how OpenDaylight works and how it differs from other SDN programs.

# What you’ll find in this guide
# To set up your environment, you first install OpenDaylight followed by the Apache Karaf features that offer the functionality you require. The OpenDaylight Getting Started Guide covers feature descriptions, OpenDaylight installation procedures, and feature installation.

# The Getting Started Guide also includes other helpful information, with the following organization:

# An overview of OpenDaylight and common use models
# OpenDaylight concepts and tools
# OpenDaylight installation instructions
# OpenDaylight user interface
# Setting Up Cluster
# Persistence and Backup
# Security considerations
