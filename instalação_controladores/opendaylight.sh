# Our Mission
# Communications providers and enterprises alike are eager to build or adapt their networks to be more flexible and responsive to their organizations’ and customers’ needs. At the same time, they are driving network automation to improve operational efficiency. OpenDaylight, the largest open source SDN controller, is helping lead this transition.
# OpenDaylight (ODL) is a modular open platform for customizing and automating networks of any size and scale. The OpenDaylight Project arose out of the SDN movement, with a clear focus on network programmability. It was designed from the outset as a foundation for commercial solutions that address a variety of use cases in existing network environments.

# Introduction
# The OpenDaylight project is an open source platform for Software Defined Networking (SDN) that uses open protocols to provide centralized, programmatic control and network device monitoring. Like many other SDN controllers, OpenDaylight supports OpenFlow, as well as offering ready-to-install network solutions as part of its platform.

# Much as your operating system provides an interface for the devices that comprise your computer, OpenDaylight provides an interface that allows you to connect network devices quickly and intelligently for optimal network performance.

# It’s extremely helpful to understand that setting up your networking environment with OpenDaylight is not a single software installation. While your first chronological step is to install OpenDaylight, you install additional functionality packaged as Karaf features to suit your specific needs.

# Before walking you through the initial OpenDaylight installation, this guide presents a fuller picture of OpenDaylight’s framework and functionality so you understand how to set up your networking environment. The guide then takes you through the installation process.
