# Communications providers and enterprises alike are eager to build or adapt their networks to be more flexible and responsive to their organizations’ and customers’ needs. At the same time, they are driving network automation to improve operational efficiency. OpenDaylight, the largest open source SDN controller, is helping lead this transition.
